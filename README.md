# Poweshell
PowerShell is a task automation and configuration management program from Microsoft, consisting of a command-line shell and the associated scripting language. Initially a Windows component only, known as Windows PowerShell, it was made open-source and cross-platform on 18 August 2016 with the introduction of PowerShell Core.[5] The former is built on the .NET Framework, the latter on .NET Core.

ARM Templates deploy Azure resources (like networking, storage, sql, vms, redis, webapp, etc). And can configure those to some extent. Whereas Powershell DSC is only good for configuring VM's (not creating them)
